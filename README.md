> POTFRecomp will one day be an unnoficial pc port of the xbox 360 version of Destroy All Humans: Path of The Furon. At this time the compilation is just a fork of <a href = "https://github.com/sonicnext-dev/MarathonRecomp">Marathon Recomp</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp">UnleashedRecomp</a>. this will not build at this time, it still needs to be stripped of anything to do with sonic 06 and or sonic unleashed, as well as needs to have the imports changed in imports.cpp
